# Datastores-2018

Datastores is your one stop local database system for Unity!

No more managing the 500 ScriptableObjects holding your static game data! Throught the use of a single magical ScriptableObject, store entire encyclopedias of data in cleanly organized and customizable lists!

 And with the power of custom property drawers, you have the ability to customize the look of the editor to your heart's content. A well designed datastore can extend productivity for designers, artists, and anyone looking to modify data at any point of the development process.
